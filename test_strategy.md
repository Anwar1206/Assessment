# Test Strategy #

## Overview ##

The “Place Bet” feature allows users to select an event, choose betting options, enter stake amounts, and confirm their wager. This strategy defines the testing approach to ensure the feature is reliable, secure, and performs well under varying conditions.

## Objectives ##

*	Validate successful placement of pets with valid inputs
*	Ensure odds, stake, and payout calculation
*	Test against invalid inputs and edge cases.
*	Verify integration with payment services
*	Confirm compliance with business rules (min/max, market constraints, etc.)
* Ensure smooth UI/UX across supported devices

## Scope ##

### In Scope ###

*	UI and API level testing for:
       *   Event selection
       *   Bet Type validation
       *   Stake entry and validation
       *   Bet Submission and confirmation
*	Security and session handling
*	Error and edge case handling
*	Compatibility across mobile, desktop and browsers

### Out of Scope ###

*	Payment settlement and withdrawal flow
*	Analytics tracking
*	Administrative bet override features

## Test Approach ##

### Functional Testing ###

*	Positive and negative bet placement scenarios
*	Validation of stake input rules
*	Real time odds updates

### API Testing ###

*	Validate endpoints for odds retrieval and bet submission
*	Check authorization (API key, token)
*	Simulate invalid payloads

### Boundary and Edge Cases ###

*	Min/Max stake limits
*	Market closure timing
*	Simultaneous bet submissions

### Automation Testing ###
Recommended for:
*	Repetitive positive/negative test flows
*	Stake boundary validations
*	API response consistency
*	Regression checks during UI Updates

## Tools ##

*	API Automation: Postman
*	UI Automation: Playwright, Selenium
*	CICD Integration: Azure Devops

## Environments ##

*	Dedicated QA Environment with bet simulator and odds feed
*	User profiles with predefined balances
*	Device/Browser matrix for UI coverage.

## Risks and Mitigations ##

*	Odds change during placement => Revalidate before submission
*	API latency on high volume => Load test and implement retries
*	Stake calculation mismatch => Backend formula verification via test cases
